    "a while back i started getting into music production, synthesizers and the like. " +
    "i don't know how exactly, but at some point i stumbled upon this really cool synthesizer pixel art. i thought: \"would be cool if that thing actually played\". " +
    "so i looked into it for a bit. <br> <br>" + "imagine, then, my excitement when i found out that modern browsers don't <i>just</i> come with digital oscillators and filters, " +
    "but also natively support the MIDI protocol! " +
    "i took that as an opportunity to step outside my comfort zone and build a minimalistic synthesizer that lives and breathes inside the browser. <br> <br>" +

    "my main goals were stability and sound quality, and for the most part, it turned out great. as an added bonus, i even managed to stick a reverb onto it! " + 
    "we played it in a jam session that summer, using an iPhone hooked up to " +
    "a MIDI controller, and we had a real blast. <br> <br>" +


    "probably my biggest issue with this project is the fact that i couldn't manage to get rid of delay issues on windows and android. " +
    "after some fiddling, i got the app to work pretty much as intended on major platforms and browsers and i concluded that the delay issue most likely resides within the windows and android " +
    "audio stacks. in the end, i'm sure a genuine audio wizard could've pulled something off, but that ain't me, and for now i'm okay with that fact. <br> <br>" +

    "it involved the outfielder problem, an active subject of debate in the fields of " +
    "sport sciences and psychology. i do recommend checking out my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRr_pa0IS0OTeS_Za6GELklBXJSkZnN1QCpEc2cmNM4M_IyyldM3t_a8Dry0PzY3eHsCnxmMP5klTLb/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000\">" + 
    "slides</a> for an overview if you're interested in reading on (there's videos in it). <br> <br>" +

    "the aim of the project was to construct a virtual reality environment which can be used " +
    "to study this problem. in broad terms, strap a headset onto a participant, run some trials, collect data " +
    "perform some predictions based on proposed mathematical models and if everything goes right, " +
    "show that there's a preference for one model or the other. <br> <br>" +

    "funnily enough, for a computer science project, it wasn't very technically demanding. " +
    "the real challenge was getting familiar enough with topics completely outside of my domain " +
    "in order to deliver a product that is scientifically appropriate for the task at hand; in other words, " +
    "we wanted this virtual environment to model the real world task closely enough so that the data we collected " +
    "is determinably relevant. turns out science is hard and in the end, it kind of worked, but it had its shortcomings*. <br> <br> " +
    
    "scientific rigour aside, the software itself is intentionally simplistic, but offers a rich (though admittedly dull) interface for monitoring ongoing trials " +
    "as well as potentially limitless configurability by supporting custom code to be introduced at runtime (in straight C#). " +
    "this was the first time i encountered the concept of reflection in C# and my mind was promptly blown. <br> <br>" +

    "it's been a very exciting project for me, having to apply computer science in a very different field, " +
    "particularly since i had a chance to work with experts in computer science as well as sports sciences. " +
    "working on such a large project has also taught me some valuable lessons about the necessity of planning " +

    "my first ever team project was this tiny game made in plain old java. " + 
    "no libraries, no funny business. we wrote it from the ground up. <br> <br>" + 
    
    "i was responsible for the controls, audio, interface, menus and most of the gameplay design aspects of it (excluding the original concept). " +
    "of course, i'm not very happy with my work from then nowadays, but i still think i was chasing the right ideas, with a focus on feedback and immersion.  " +

    "on the bright side, we all learned so much by having to research every aspect of " + 
    "how a game actually runs, from the graphics engine, mess of audio streams, <i> networking (oh god networking)</i>, " + 
    "procedural generation, down to the complex systems that linked everything up. <br> <br>" + 

    "on the other, less bright side, well, it didn't really work. it actually did work fine for the most part, <i> except </i> for the networking bit. " + 
    "unfortunately, networking just happened to sit at the core of the entire game, since even \"single player\" ran a server locally. " + 
    "this means that the game is more or less unplayable, although on some lucky systems it does run fine for up to two players. <br> <br>" + 

    "this was kind of a bummer because the game would actually be quite fun if it ran better. we know, because we used to play an older build without networking " + 
    "in order to test new gameplay features. but networking was a main requirement for the system and we now have to live with it being the way it is. <br> <br> " +

    "i did start on revamping the networking system a couple times, but i was discouraged by the unsavoury amounts of spaghetti code and gave up. " + 
    "now, i've come to terms with the fact that we improve over time, and it's not really worth trying to fix old, uninteresting projects. " +
